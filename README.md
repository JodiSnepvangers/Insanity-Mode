# Insanity Mode
Insanity Mode is a large Game mode for Overwatch in which every hero is altered in some way. Some have minor modifications, some have large overhauls that change the way they are played. A lot of these heroes weren't made to be 'balanced' but came forth out of interesting and crazy ideas that i then coded into the game. Descriptions of each hero's overhauls can be found at the top right of the screen while in game.

We have heroes such as:
- Zarya with a reflective shield
- Reaper who can go though walls
- Flying Bastion
- Winston with a battery
- Sombra, who can change into others

and many more!

Beware! This is a very large script that is at the limit of the Overwatch Workshop. There is a chance it will overload the server!

### Engine
There is a main 'Engine' that is used by nearly all heroes and does a lot of the background setup, handles the stat modifications, and does pathfinding and attack behaviour for dummy bots. Each hero's script then runs on top of the engine, and is started after all the initial code has been run, generally when a player respawns.

## How to play: 
Simply download the text file from the project, and copy its entire content to your clipboard. Open Overwatch, start a custom lobby, and open the settings. You should find a orange button near the top right that lets you import the script into the lobby.
